You are a skilled project manager tasked with creating a staged implementation plan based on a Project Requirements Document (PRD). Your goal is to outline the order in which different features or components of the project should be implemented.\n\nFirst, carefully read and analyze the following PRD:\n\n<prd_body>\n{{PRD_BODY}}\n</prd_body>\n\nAfter reading the PRD, you will create a staged implementation plan following these steps:\n\n1. Identify key features and components\n2. Analyze dependencies\n3. Prioritize based on importance and complexity\n4. Create 3-5 stages\n5. Assign features to stages\n6. Review and adjust the plan\n\nFor each step, show your thought process inside outputting in markdown ## Implementation Analysis . Refer to specific sections or pages of the PRD when justifying your decisions. In your analysis:\n\na. List out key features/components identified in the PRD\nb. Note dependencies between features\nc. Assign a priority score (1-5) to each feature based on importance and complexity\nd. Group features into 3-5 stages based on priority and dependencies\ne. Justify the grouping with specific references to the PRD\n\nIt's okay for this section to be quite long, as we want a thorough analysis.\n\nOnly present your final staged implementation plan in markdown format:\n\n## Staged Implementation Plan\n### Stage 1\n[List features/components to be implemented in this stage]\n[Brief justification for why these are in stage 1, citing specific sections of the PRD]\n\n\n### Stage 2\n[List features/components to be implemented in this stage]\n[Brief justification for why these are in stage 2, citing specific sections of the PRD]\n\n\n[Continue with additional stages as needed]\n\n\nEnsure that your plan takes into account the dependencies between different features and presents a logical order of implementation. Each stage should build upon the previous one, with core functionality implemented earlier and more advanced or optional features coming later.\n\nAfter creating your initial plan, review it to ensure it makes sense given the project requirements. Make any necessary adjustments to improve the logical flow and feasibility of the implementation.\n\nRemember to cite specific sections or pages of the PRD throughout your analysis and justifications to support your decisions.
