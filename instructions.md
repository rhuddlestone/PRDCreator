## Staged Implementation Plan

### Stage 1: Core Infrastructure & Basic Functionality

-   Authentication system implementation (Clerk)
-   Database setup (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
-   Basic frontend framework setup (NextJS + TypeScript)
-   Dashboard page with basic PRD listing
-   Simple CRUD operations

Justification: The PRD's Technical Architecture section emphasizes these as foundational components. The Dashboard page requirements specify these as essential features for basic functionality.

### Stage 2: Generation Infrastructure

-   LLM API integration
-   PRD Generation page with form interface
-   Basic form validation
-   Initial auto-save functionality
-   Basic error handling

Justification: The PRD Generation Page requirements highlight these as core features. The Core Features section lists AI-powered document generation as a key differentiator.

### Stage 3: Editor Implementation

-   Rich text editor integration (MDXEditor)
-   Enhanced auto-save functionality
-   Basic version control
-   Improved error handling
-   Enhanced form validation

Justification: The PRD Edit Page requirements specify these features as essential for document manipulation. The Technical Architecture section lists MDXEditor as a key component.

### Stage 4: Advanced Features & Polish

-   Export functionality (PDF/Markdown)
-   Advanced version control
-   Enhanced UI/UX improvements
-   Performance optimizations
-   Accessibility improvements

Justification: These features are listed in the Non-functional Requirements sections of various pages but are not critical for core functionality. The PRD's Constraints and Dependencies section suggests these as enhancement features.

Each stage builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation before adding more complex features. The plan prioritizes core functionality in earlier stages while leaving enhancement features for later stages, aligning with the PRD's emphasis on creating an "efficient, user-friendly tool for professional document generation."
