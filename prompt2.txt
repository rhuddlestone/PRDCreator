You are tasked with writing a section of a Project Requirements Document for a web application. Specifically, you will be writing requirements for a single page of the app. Your goal is to create clear, concise, and actionable requirements based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, review the background information about the app:\n\n<app_background>\n{{APP_BACKGROUND}}\n</app_background>\n\nNow, focus on the specific page you'll be writing requirements for:\n\nPage Name: {{PAGE_NAME}}\n\nPage Description:\n<page_description>\n{{PAGE_DESCRIPTION}}\n</page_description>\n\nUsing the information provided, write a set of requirements for this page. Follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Start with a brief overview of the page's purpose.\n2. List functional requirements (what the page should do).\n3. List non-functional requirements (how the page should perform or appear).\n4. Use clear, concise language.\n5. Make each requirement specific and measurable where possible.\n6. Number each requirement for easy reference.\n7. Use \"shall\" statements to indicate mandatory requirements.\n\nFormat your output in markdown as follows:\n\n## Page Name\n\n[Brief overview of the page's purpose]\n\n\n### Functional Requirements\n1. The page shall [requirement]\n2. The page shall [requirement]\n[Continue numbering as needed]\n\n\n### Non-functional Requirements\n1. The page shall [requirement]\n2. The page shall [requirement]\n[Continue numbering as needed]\n\n\nRemember to focus solely on the information provided in the app background and page description. Do not make assumptions or add features that are not explicitly mentioned. If you feel there's not enough information to create a comprehensive set of requirements, state this in your overview and provide requirements based on what you can reasonably infer from the given information.
